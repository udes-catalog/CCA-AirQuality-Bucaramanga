## üß≠ Overview

This dataset contains air quality and meteorological data collected in Bucaramanga, Colombia, for the purpose of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to study the relationships between atmospheric pollutants and climatic conditions.

The dataset includes measurements of pollutants (O‚ÇÉ, PM2.5, PM10, SO‚ÇÇ) and meteorological variables (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity) from multiple monitoring stations in Bucaramanga, covering the period 2021‚Äì2023. It is intended for use in environmental science, urban planning, and data-driven policy research.
